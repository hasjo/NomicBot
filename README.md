# A Nomic Bot for Discord

## WHAT IS THIS
This is a discord bot designed for the facilitation of a game of Nomic. Your follow up question could be: What is Nomic? Good question. Nomic is a game about legislation. The point of the game is making and amending rules based on a base set of rules. The goal is to figure out a way to win the game that is allowed via the rules. FUN!

## WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
Seemed like a fun programming task

## HOW DO I USE THIS?
There's a text file in this repo called setup.txt that provides an incredibly barebones list of channels you could create and the commands to initiate them into the data structure. From there you would probably want a points channel, I'm managing that myself at the moment.
